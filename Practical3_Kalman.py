# ðŸ“ˆ Kalman Filter Visualization - 2D Localization
#
# This plot helps visualize the performance of the Kalman Filter
# in estimating a robot's position in 2D space.
#
# âž¤ Green Dashed Line (True Path):
#     - The actual path the robot is expected to follow.
#     - Used for validation in simulation; not available in real-world scenarios.
#
# âž¤ Red Crosses (Measured Positions):
#     - Noisy measurements simulating real-world sensor inputs (e.g., GPS).
#     - Show how far off raw data can be from the true location.
#
# âž¤ Blue Line (Kalman Estimated Path):
#     - The output of the Kalman Filter.
#     - This is a smoothed estimate based on previous state + current measurement.
#     - It tends to stay close to the true path while ignoring measurement noise.
#
# âœ… Interpretation:
#     - The Kalman Filter effectively reduces measurement noise.
#     - Estimated path is more reliable than raw sensor readings.
#     - Used in robotics to improve localization accuracy in uncertain environments.
